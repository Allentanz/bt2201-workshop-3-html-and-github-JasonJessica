# bt2201-html

Just like in last week's workshop you will add some content to this very basic html document. The html document is called 'myfirst.html' and can be found in this repository. 

You can edit the document directly in the GitHub web interface if you like. You can't really test whether your files work correctly though as you can only see the code. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can use the git command in the command line or you can use a GUI client, e.g. GitHub Desktop.

1. Add a heading with the following text to the html document 

   `My First Heading for BT2201`

   This heading should be a heading of the highest order / the most important heading.

2. Then add a paragraph with the following text to the html document, under the heading

   `My first paragraph for BT2201`

   Make sure you mark it up as a paragraph / use the paragraph tag.
