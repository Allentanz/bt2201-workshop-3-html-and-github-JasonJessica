# BT2201 Task HTML

## Introduction

Just like in last week's workshop you will add some content to a very basic html document. The html document is called 'myfirst.html' and can be found in this repository. 

You can edit the document directly in the GitHub web interface if you like. If you do that you can't really test whether your file works correctly though as you can only see the code, but can't run it in the web interface. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can link your GitHub account to PHPStorm or use GitHub Desktop (there are many more ways but these two are the most convenient).

## Task

Here's what to do with 'myfirst.html', it's exactly the same as what you did last week:

1. Add a heading with the following text to the html document 

   `My First Heading for BT2201`

   This heading should be a heading of the highest order / the most important heading.

2. Then add a paragraph with the following text to the html document, under the heading

   `My first paragraph for BT2201`

   Make sure you mark it up as a paragraph / use the paragraph tag.
