# bt2201-html


Just like in last week's workshop add some content to this very basic html document. the html document is called 'myfirst.html' and can be found in this repository. 

1. Add a heading with the following text to the html document 

   `My First Heading for BT2201`

   This heading should be a heading of the highest order / the most important heading.

2. Then add a paragraph with the following text to the html document, under the heading

   `My first paragraph for BT2201`

   Make sure you mark it up as a paragraph / use the paragraph tag.
